I first went to the second link which roughly said "round 1:or".
I didn't know what it meant so i typed gibberish into the username and password and in the background i could see a SQL statement.
i then typed another set of gibberish with "or" in it which didn't  get submitted i guess as there was no sql in background.
So I started tying in "admin';" as username which made it terminte after checking the username which helped me through 3 rounds but in 4th round the word "admin" was
a banned word so i used the || operater to concat "ad" and "min" to get over the problem which worked for the other 2 rounds and i got the flag
