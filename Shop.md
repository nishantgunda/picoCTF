I first pressed on sell to try to trick it but I couldn't do it as it said that i have nothing to sell.Then i bought 1 Quiet Quich then tried to sell 7 of them which again 
didn't work but then I tried my last play i bought -10 quiches so intsead it gave me 100 coins so i had 130 coins now so i used 100 to buy the flag.
