I entered my username as joe i wasn't able to login and it said  "I'm sorry Joe's password is super secure. You're not getting in that way."
but when i used random name and password but there was no flag.So I first inspected it and found out that there was a cookie named admin which had a value "False" so i
changed it to true and refreshed the page to get the flag
